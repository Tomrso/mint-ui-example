# Mint a business card!

This is an app that I created to learn how to make a candymachine and let people mint NFT's from it.
I built the candymachine using the metaplex Sugar CLI and filled it with NFT's. There are only 20, I can add more if it ever runs out. They are only of a single image and are not generetive.

The main page utilises the solana wallet adapter so that any wallet can connect to the app. Once connected you can mint an NFT for 0.1 SOL (devnet). 
The mint button accesses the metaplex candy machine and mints a new NFT and sends it to your account.
